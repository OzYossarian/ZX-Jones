\section{From a Link to a ZX-Diagram}

We begin by describing the passage from a link $L$ to a ZX-diagram $D$ which represents the evaluation of the Jones polynomial of $L$ at lattice roots of unity. The majority of this journey is as detailed in \cite{jones_tensors}, though the final small step into the ZX-calculus is new. This section aims to be comprehensible to those with no background in topology or statistical mechanics; we introduce only as many terms as needed to describe the passage fully, keeping definitions simple and providing several figures. After this first jargon-heavy section, we will be working almost exclusively in a ZX setting.\newline

We will define a knot $K$ to be a circle smoothly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. More generally, an \textit{n-component link} $L$ will be a smooth embedding of $n$ disjoint circles in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A \textit{link diagram} for $L$ is a projection of the link onto some plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but with over- and undercrossing information retained. Thus a given link has infinitely many link diagrams. Intuitively, a link diagram is what one produces when one attempts to draw a link in two dimensions. An \textit{oriented link} has a direction assigned to each component knot; this is indicated in a link diagram by an arrow. As an example, we show diagrams for two different orientations of the trefoil knot linked with an unknot:\newline

[Insert diagram]\newline

Two oriented links $L$ and $L'$ are isotopic, written $L \simeq L'$, if and only if there is a finite sequence of \textit{Reidemeister moves} taking a diagram for $L$ to a diagram for $L'$. These moves, shown in Appendix [ToDo ref], precisely capture the notion of reversible local strand deformations that do not change the topology. For example, they do not permit breaking or gluing of strands, passing one strand through another, or reversing of orientations. The \textit{Jones polynomial} $V_L(z)$ for an oriented link $L$ is a polynomial in $z \in \mathbb{C}$. It is a \textit{link invariant}; that is, $V_L(z) \neq V_{L'}(z)$ implies $L \not\simeq L'$, for any two oriented links $L$ and $L'$. In general, computing $V_L(z)$ is exponentially costly in the number $\abs{C}$ of crossings of $L$, but it is known that at the special cases of the \textit{lattice roots of unity} $z \in \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}, \pm e^{i\frac{4\pi}{3}}\}$ it can be evaluated in time polynomial in $\abs{C}$ [Welsh]:\newline

[Draw lattice roots of unity]\newline

Let $z_q = \frac{1}{2}\left(q - 2 + \sqrt{q(q - 4)}\right)$, and note the correspondence $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) = (e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}, i, e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}, 1)$ with the lattice roots of unity. Remarkably, the Jones polynomial $V_L(z_q)$ at the points $q \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ can be expressed in terms of the \textit{partition function} $Z(q)$ of a \textit{$q$-state Potts model} [Wu]. For those with no statistical mechanical background, given some graph $G = (V, E)$, a $q$-state Potts model on $G$ can just be thought of as the ability to assign a \textit{spin} $\sigma_v \in \{1, ..., q\}$ to each vertex $v \in V$, along with a partition function $Z: \{1, .., q\} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, which in physics usually captures some thermodynamical properties of a system. This function has an explicit formula in the general case, but it will make more sense to defer stating this until we have introduced enough terminology to give a simpler formula pertaining to our circumstances (see [ToDo] below). A particular assignment $\sigma = (\sigma_1, ..., \sigma_{\abs{V}})$ of spins to each vertex will be called a \textit{configuration}.\newline

In our case, we will define a Potts model on a particular \textit{signed graph} - a graph in which every edge has a positive or negative sign - called a \textit{Tait graph} of the link $L$. This is denoted $G_L = (V_L, E_L)$ and obtained as follows. First, an arbitrary link diagram for $L$ is given a \textit{checkerboard colouring}. That is, regions of $\mathbb{R}^2$ carved out by the link are shaded black or white such that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. For any diagram for $L$ there are exactly two equivalent ways to do this, the difference between the two just being that the roles of black and white are swapped throughout. Therefore we fix a convention that the unique unbounded region surrounding the link (i.e. the background) will be white.\newline

[Diagram]\newline

Next, every shaded (black) region is mapped to a vertex and every crossing is mapped to a signed edge $e = vw$ according to its orientation relative to the surrounding colours, per the rule shown in [ToDo] below. The signs $\varepsilon_{vw} = \pm$ of these edges are called \textit{Tait signs} and are graphically denoted by a small box on the corresponding edge, labelled with either a plus or minus sign appropriately. If we now define a Potts model on $G_L$, the partition function $Z(q)$ has the following formula. We sum over all possible configurations $\sigma$ of spins, and within each term we multiply together the values $-z_q^{-\varepsilon_{vw}}$ for all edges $vw$ whose endpoints have the same spin in this configuration. That is:

\begin{equation}
	Z(q) = \sum_{\sigma} \left( \prod_{vw \in E_L} T_{\sigma_v, \sigma_w}^{(q)} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	T_{\sigma_v, \sigma_{w}}^{(q)}
	= \begin{cases}
		-z_q^{-\varepsilon_{vw}} &\ \ \text{if} \ \ \sigma_v = \sigma_{w} \\  
		1 &\ \ \text{if} \ \ \sigma_v \neq \sigma_{w}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

For fixed $v, w$ we can view $T_{(-)_v,(-)_w}^{(q)} \eqdef T_{\varepsilon_{vw}}^{(q)}$ as a $q \times q$ matrix, indexed by the possible spins $\{1, ..., q\}$ that could be assigned to $v$ and $w$: 

\begingroup
	\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.5}
	\begin{equation}
	T_{-_v,-_w}^{(q)}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		-z_q^{-\varepsilon_{vw}} & 1 & \dots & 1 \\
		1 & -z_q^{-\varepsilon_{vw}} & \dots & 1 \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
		1 & 1  & \dots & -z_q^{-\varepsilon_{vw}}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\endgroup

Finally, the actual statement relating the Jones polynomial to the partition function is:

\begin{equation}
	V_L(z_q) = \mathcal{A}_L(q)Z(q)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{A}_L(q)$ is an efficiently computable prefactor, whose definition is given in Appendix [ToDo]. 
% For completeness, we give its formula, where $w(L)$ denotes the \textit{writhe} of the link $L$ [ToDo: ref], and the \textit{Tait number} $\tau(L)$ is the sum $\sum_{vw \in E_L} \varepsilon_{vw}$ of all the Tait signs:
% \begin{equation}
% 	\mathcal{A}_L(q) = (-z_q^{\frac{1}{2}} - z_q^{-\frac{1}{2}})^{-\abs{V_L} - 1}(-z_q^{\frac{3}{4}})^{w(L)}z_q^{\frac{1}{4}\tau(L)}
% \end{equation}

\begin{remark}
	Of course, different diagrams for $L$ will lead to different (non-isomorphic) Tait graphs $G_L$. Ultimately, however, this will not matter to us. This is because the Tait signs are related to $z_q$ in such a way that graph operations on $G_L$ corresponding to Reidemeister moves on $L$ leave $Z(q)$ (ToDo: and therefore $\mathcal{A}_L(q)$?) invariant [ToDo: ref].
	 % $\varepsilon_{vw} = \pm$ determine \textit{spin-spin interactions} $J_{\pm} = \text{[ToDo]}$, which are related to the variable $z_q$ of the Jones polynomial $V_L(z_q)$ via the equality $z_q = -e^{\mp J_\pm}$. As a result, it can be shown [ToDo ref] that the interactions $J_\pm$ are such that the graph operations on $G_L$ corresponding to Reidemeister moves on $L$ leave $Z(q)$ invariant. 
\end{remark}



% After defining a Potts model on the Tait graph $G_L$, every signed edge indicates a \textit{spin-spin Tait-sign-dependent interaction} $J_\pm \in \mathbb{C}$. These interactions relate to the variable $z$ of the Jones polynomial via the equality $z = -e^{\mp J_\pm}$. The role of the link invariant is played by the partition function $Z(q)$; in fact, the interactions $J_\pm$ are such that the graph operations on $G_L$ corresponding to Reidemeister moves on $L$ leave $Z(q)$ invariant. Specifically, $Z(q)$ is related to the Jones polynomial by $V_L(z) = \mathcal{A}_L(z)Z(q)$, where $A_L(z)$ is an efficiently computable value which handles bookeeping of twist factors [Definition?]. Its explicit definition is given in [ToDo] in the Appendix. has the following explicit formula: [Check again with Kon!]\newline
